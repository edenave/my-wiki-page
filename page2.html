                    Don't Crowd Tomato Seedlings
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you are starting tomatoes from seed, give the seedlings plenty of room to branch out. Yes, that means thinning the seedlings to one strong plant per cell or small pot.

                <li> <h3 class="tomatotips">
                    Provide Lots of Light
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tomato seedlings need strong, direct light. Days are short during winter, so even placing them near a sunny window may not provide them with sufficient natural light. Unless you are growing them in a greenhouse, your best option is to use some type of artificial plant lighting for 14 to 18 hours every day.  
                </p>

                <li> <h3 class="tomatotips">
                    Turn a Fan On
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tomato plants need to move and sway in the breeze to develop strong stems. That happens naturally outdoors, but if you start your seedlings inside, you need to provide some type of air circulation.

                    Preheat the Garden Soil
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Tomatoes love heat. They won't really start to grow until both the soil and air temperatures remain warm.

                    Bury the Stems
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Plant your tomato plants deeper than they come in the pot, all the way up to the top few leaves. 
                </p>

                    Mulch Tomatoes After the Soil Has Warmed
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you are not going to leave plastic on the soil, hold off on putting down mulch until after the ground has had a chance to warm up.

                    Remove the Bottom Leaves
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After your tomato plants reach about 3 feet tall, remove the leaves from the bottom foot of the stem. 
                </p>

                    Pinch and Prune for More Tomatoes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Pinch and remove suckers that develop in the crotch joint of two branches. They won’t bear fruit and will take energy away from the rest of the plant.

                    Water Regularly
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Water deeply and regularly while the fruits are developing. Irregular watering—missing a week and trying to make up for it—leads to blossom end rot (a calcium deficiency) and cracking and splitting.

                <p>
                    Pinching off the tips of the main stems in early summer will encourage indeterminate tomatoes (those with fruit available continuously) to start putting their energy into flowering.
